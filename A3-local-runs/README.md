# Graphless

## A3 - Introducing Neo4j
In this implementation we provide a naïve version of Neo4j as database:
* Neo4j implementation is very similar to the one provided for Redis in the original Graphless work (for a better implementation, you can replace the methods of `neo4j_memory_client.go` with the implementation in A5)
* fully supports local runs


### MacOS installation
```bash
$ make clean-local build-local
```

### Linux installation
```bash
$ make clean build
```

### Amazon installation
* To deploy the cloud stack (Amazon Lambda) on AWS use the following:
    ```bash
    $ bash deploy.sh -t false
    ```
* Run on Amazon EC2 the following scripts depending on the technology used as MaaS:
  * neo4j_script.sh to install and configure Neo4j:
    ```bash
     $ ./neo4j_script.sh
    ```
  * redis_script.sh to install Redis:
    ```bash
     $ ./redis_script.sh 16 7379 redis
     $ ./redis_script.sh 16 7379 start
    ```

### Local runs
We run local experiments on a MacBook, with the MaaS components executing as Docker containers.
To execute the program locally, make sure to pass the `local` executing to the `main_function`.

We run Neo4j containers on Docker with:
```bash
$ docker run --rm --name neo4j \
        -p 7687:7687 -p 7474:7474 \
         --env NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/n \
        neo4j:4.4.6
```

We run Redis containers on Docker with:
```bash
$ docker run --rm --name redis \
        -p 6379:6379 \
        redis:6.2.6-alpine3.15
```

To start Graphless locally run the following command:
```bash
$ ./bin-local/main_function/main_function local
```

### Configuration
In this version of Graphless, differently from A5, the MaaS backend is chosen programmatically for local or AWS runs.
Therefore, to specify the backend used for each client you might need to do some code changes.

In `main_function.go`, `orchestrator_function.go`, and `worker_function.go`, set the following variables according to the backend you choose:
* `memoryClientType`: backend for MaaS
* `storageClientType`: backend for S3 bucket
